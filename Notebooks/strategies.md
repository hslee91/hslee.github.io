# Resistance Strategies
## Contesting
### Contesting the Content
Directly counter-arguing against the claims made in messages by giving counterarguments. 

Ex. *“It is impossible to choose what is more sickening in this editorial: its distortion of what Rev. King stood for and fought for, which was certainly to change, not conserve, US institutional and legal racism.”*

### Contesting the Source
Countering messages by questioning the expertise and validity of the source.

Ex. *“The research is discredited thus I can’t believe it.”*

### Contesting the Strategies Used
Resisting by focusing on persuasive strategies used in messages, detecting persuasion tactics.

Ex. *“The author is using his personal story to persuade our attitude change.”*

## Empowerment
### Attitude Bolstering
Generating thoughts that are consistent with the exiting opposite attitudes (without refuting the arguments in messages).

Ex. *“Yes, but there is another important factor that should be taken into account, which is. . .”*

### Social Validation
Counter-arguing messages by seeking validation from significant others who also disagree.

Ex. *“There are still many other people who don’t believe in this.”*

### Self Assertions
Asserting the self by reminding that nothing can change their attitudes or behavior because we are confident about ourselves.

Ex. *“I voted for Remain and my opinion hasn’t changed, and it will not change.”*

## Negative Affect
Responding to the persuasive attempt by getting angry, irritated, sarcastic, or upset.

Ex. *“1000 unlikes, so much views. Congratulations Sir.”*
